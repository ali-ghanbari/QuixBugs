# QuixBugs Benchmark Specialized for Java and Maven
This repository is forked from original [QuixBugs](https://github.com/jkoppel/QuixBugs) repository. We have deleted all the information for Python programs and constructed Maven projects for the Java programs.

We have made the following changes:
* Removed all non-java parts
* Translated Java 8 programs into Java 7
* Eliminated all the compile errors
* Placed each program (together with its test cases) in a Maven project

## Legal Notes
This work is just a modification of the original QuixBugs for our own purposes.
